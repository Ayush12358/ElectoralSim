# POLICY BRIEF: Optimizing Political Stability & Representativeness

**Target Audience**: Law Commission of India, Election Commission of India.

## Executive Summary
India's First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system exhibits extreme representational distortion (**Gallagher Index 0.5616**). Computational modeling shows that **List-PR** can reduce this distortion by over 88% (to **0.0663**) while maintaining a 4.86-year stability cycle in most social contexts.

## Key Computational Findings
- **The Gallagher Gap**: FPTP produces a Gallagher Index of **0.5616**, effectively silencing diverse regional nuances in favor of monolithic blocs.
- **Regional Resilience**: A fragmented party system remains highly stable under PR, with a Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of **4.05 years**.
- **The Polarization Warning**: In polarized societies, stability drops to **1.31 years**, highlighting the limits of purely institutional solutions.

## Policy Recommendations
1.  **Adopt List-PR with a 5% Threshold**: This provides a "Stability Bridge" specifically for polarized scenarios while allowing for 80%+ fairness gains in normal scenarios.
2.  **Institutionalize ABM Monitoring**: Use Agent-Based Models to monitor geopolitical and ideological strain within the Lok Sabha.
