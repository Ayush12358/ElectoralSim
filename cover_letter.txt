Dear Editor,

I am writing to submit my original research paper, titled "Simulating the Stability-Proportionality Trade-off: A Computational Counterfactual Analysis of Proportional Representation in the Indian Parliamentary System," for consideration for publication in your journal.

This paper addresses the long-standing "Stability Anxiety" in Indian electoral reform debates. Using a large-scale (100k agent) Agent-Based Model (ABM) built on spatial ideology concepts, I simulate the 2024 general election under counterfactual List-PR rules across diverse societal scenarios.

Our key findings demonstrate that the perceived trade-off between representativeness and stability is manageable through institutional design. Specifically, my results identify a 5% electoral threshold as a robust "Stability Bridge"—reducing representational distortion by over 75% compared to the current FPTP baseline while maintaining government durability (MTTF ~4.8 years) consistent with term limits. Crucially, the model identifies a "Polarization Trap" where societal sentiment, rather than electoral rules, becomes the primary driver of instability.

This research contributes to the field of Computational Social Science by transforming a historical constitutional debate into a quantitative, evidence-based optimization problem.

I confirm that this work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by any other journal. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Ayush Maurya
