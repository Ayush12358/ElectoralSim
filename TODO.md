## 🗳️ VOTING BEHAVIOR MODELS

### Spatial Voting Models

#### Proximity Model (current implementation)
- [x] Vote for nearest party in ideological space
- Uses Minkowski distance with configurable p parameter

#### Directional Model (Rabinowitz-Macdonald 1989)
- [ ] **Utility = voter_intensity × candidate_intensity × direction_sign**
  - direction_sign = +1 if same side of neutral point, -1 otherwise
- [ ] Voters prefer candidates on same side of issue
- [ ] More extreme candidates preferred if on correct side
- [ ] **Region of Acceptability** — penalty for too-extreme positions

#### Unified Model
- [ ] Combine proximity + directional with weights: U = α×(proximity) + (1-α)×(directional)

### Probabilistic Voting (McFadden)

#### Multinomial Logit (MNL)
- [x] Deterministic (argmax) — current implementation
- [ ] **P(vote for j) = exp(V_j / τ) / Σ exp(V_k / τ)**
  - V_j = systematic utility for party j
  - **τ = temperature parameter** — controls randomness (low = deterministic, high = random)
- [ ] **IIA property** — Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (ratio of probabilities unchanged by adding alternative)

#### Advanced Logit Models
- [ ] **Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL)** — relaxes IIA, allows heterogeneous preferences
- [ ] **Nested Logit** — groups similar alternatives in "nests"

### Valence Voting
- [ ] **Non-policy competence attributes** (each 0-100):
  - Leadership quality, charisma
  - Character/integrity, honesty
  - Experience, legislative skill
  - Credibility (delivering on promises)
- [ ] **Combined utility:** U = α×(policy proximity) + (1-α)×(valence score)
- [ ] High-valence candidates can adopt more moderate positions

### Turnout Model (Riker-Ordeshook 1968)
- [ ] **Calculus of Voting: V = pB - C + D**
  - **p** = probability vote is decisive (very small, ~1/N)
  - **B** = benefit if preferred candidate wins (differential)
  - **C** = cost of voting (time, effort, information)
  - **D** = **civic duty / expressive benefit** (key to explaining turnout paradox)
- [ ] **Alienation** — don't vote if all candidates too far from ideal point
- [ ] **Indifference** — don't vote if candidates too similar

### Strategic Voting (Tactical Voting)
- [ ] Voting for non-preferred viable candidate to prevent worst outcome
- [ ] Driven by fear of **wasted vote** (votes for losing candidates)
- [ ] **Third-party squeeze** — minor parties suppressed in FPTP
- [ ] **Spoiler effect** — third party splits vote with ideologically similar major party

### Voter Models *(from elsim)*
- [ ] **Impartial Culture (IC)** — each voter ranking is equally likely (random permutation)
- [ ] **Random Utilities** — each voter-candidate utility drawn from distribution
- [ ] **Normal Electorate (Spatial)** — voters/candidates positioned in N-dimensional Gaussian space
  - Distance → utility (normed_dist_utilities)
- [ ] **1D/2D Spatial Visualization** — "Yee diagrams" showing which candidate wins at each point

### Ballot Strategies *(from elsim)*
- [ ] **Honest Rankings** — rank by true utility
- [ ] **Honest Normed Scores** — score proportional to utility
- [ ] **Approval Optimal** — approve all candidates above mean utility
- [ ] **Vote for K** — approve top K candidates

### Heuristics
- [ ] **Party heuristic** — vote by party label alone
- [ ] **Incumbent heuristic** — default to status quo
- [ ] **Likability heuristic** — personality-based voting
- [ ] **Elite cues** — follow trusted opinion leaders
- [ ] **Appearance heuristic** — attractiveness bias

- [ ] **Droop quota** — quota = floor(votes / (seats + 1)) + 1
- [ ] **Huntington-Hill** — geometric mean divisors (US apportionment)
- [ ] **Modified Sainte-Laguë** — first divisor 1.4 (Swedish method)

### Electoral System Types

#### Proportional Representation
- [x] **Party-list PR** (current)
- [ ] **MMP (Mixed-Member Proportional)** — Germany model:
  - **Erststimme** (first vote) — constituency direct candidate (FPTP)
  - **Zweitstimme** (second vote) — party list (determines overall proportionality)
  - **Überhangmandate** — overhang seats when constituency > proportional entitlement
  - **Ausgleichsmandate** — leveling/compensatory seats to restore proportionality
  - 2023 Reform: fixed 630 seats, abolishes overhang/leveling
- [ ] **STV (Single Transferable Vote)**:
  - **Droop quota**: floor(votes/(seats+1)) + 1
  - Surplus transfer: fractional value = surplus / total_votes
  - **Gregory method** — transfer last parcel at fractional value
  - **Meek method** — keep factors, iterative recalculation
  - Elimination of lowest, votes transfer to next preference

#### Majoritarian/Plurality
- [ ] **FPTP** — single-member districts, plurality wins
- [ ] **Two-round runoff** — if no majority, top two compete in second round
- [ ] **RCV/IRV** — eliminate lowest, transfer votes until majority

#### Alternative Systems
- [ ] **Condorcet Methods**:
  - **Condorcet Winner** — beats all others in pairwise comparison
  - **Condorcet Paradox / Cycling** — A>B>C>A, no clear winner
  - **Condorcet-completion methods** — resolve cycles (Schulze, Ranked Pairs)
- [ ] **Schulze Method** — strongest path through tournament graph
- [ ] **Borda Count** — points by rank (n-1, n-2, ..., 0)
- [ ] **Approval Voting** — vote for all acceptable candidates, most approvals wins
- [ ] **Score/Range Voting** — rate candidates 0-5, highest total wins
- [ ] **STAR Voting** — Score Then Automatic Runoff:
  - Rate 0-5, sum scores
  - Top 2 by score → automatic runoff by preferences

#### Additional Voting Methods *(from elsim)*
- [ ] **Black's Method** — Condorcet winner if exists, else Borda winner
- [ ] **Coombs Method** — eliminate candidate with most last-place votes
- [ ] **SNTV (Single Non-Transferable Vote)** — multi-winner plurality
- [ ] **Two-Round Runoff** — top 2 if no majority, then second round

### Electoral Rules

#### Thresholds
- [x] National threshold (implemented) — 0%, 5%, 10%
- [ ] **Natural/effective threshold** — 75% / (M + 1) where M = district magnitude
- [ ] **Regional thresholds**

#### Theoretical Laws
- [ ] **Duverger's Law** — FPTP → 2-party system
  - **Mechanical effect** — small parties don't win seats
  - **Psychological effect** — voters avoid "wasting" votes on small parties
- [ ] **M+1 Rule (Cox 1997)** — max viable parties ≈ district magnitude + 1

- [ ] 72% decide >2 months before election
- [ ] **Debate bumps often temporary** — "sample artifacts"
- [ ] Primary debates more persuasive (~60% mind changes) than general election debates
- [ ] Post-debate media framing may matter more than debate content

### Scandal Effects
- [ ] **Vote penalty** — 6-11% vote share decrease for corruption

- [ ] **Moderators**: partisanship, media coverage, scandal type (financial > moral)
- [ ] Long-term trust erosion, especially for first-time voters during scandal

### Voter Suppression

## 🏛️ THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Social Choice Theorems

#### Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
- [ ] No ranked-choice voting system (≥3 alternatives) can satisfy all:
  1. **Unrestricted Domain** — any preference ordering allowed
  2. **Non-dictatorship** — no single voter determines outcome
  3. **Pareto Efficiency** — if all prefer A>B, society prefers A>B
  4. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives** — A vs B unaffected by C
  5. **Social Ordering / Transitivity** — no A>B>C>A cycles

#### Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem
- [ ] Any deterministic voting rule (≥3 alternatives) must be either:
  - **Dictatorial**, OR
  - **Manipulable** (strategic voting beneficial)
- [ ] Related to Arrow via IIA ↔ strategy-proofness connection
- [ ] **Pivotal voter** argument in proof

#### Median Voter Theorem (Black-Downs)
- [ ] Under majority rule + single-peaked preferences:
  - **Median voter's preferred position wins**
- [ ] **Downs Convergence** — parties move toward center in two-party systems
- [ ] **Assumptions**: single dimension, full information, two candidates
- [ ] Relaxations lead to divergence, polarization

### Party Behavior
- [ ] **Mainstream parties** track median voter, adapt to shifts
- [ ] **Niche parties** prioritize policy/ideology over median voter
- [ ] **Critical elections** — realignments from major events
- [ ] Voters may shift preferences to match preferred party (elite cue-taking)
