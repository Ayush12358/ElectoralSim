# 18. POLLING & FORECASTING SYSTEMS

## 18.1 Polling Mechanics

### 18.1.1 Poll Methodology
- **Poll Sample:**
  - Population (all adults, registered voters, likely voters)
  - Sample size (n, affects margin of error)
  - Sampling method (random digit dialing, online, panel, etc.)
  - Weighting (reweight sample to match population demographics)
  - Response rate (what percentage respond to survey)

- **Poll Questionnaire:**
  - Questions asked (order matters—earlier questions affect later)
  - Question wording (subtle differences change answers)
  - Scale used (approve/disapprove, favorable/unfavorable, support/oppose)
  - Undecided option (offered or forced choice)
  - Question ambiguity (clear or confusing questions)

- **Margin of Error:**
  - Calculation (based on sample size, typical ±3%)
  - Confidence level (95%, meaning result ±3% in 95 of 100 polls)
  - House effect (systematic bias of specific pollster)
  - Correlations (polls correlated with each other, not independent)

### 18.1.2 Poll Timing & Dynamics
- **When Polls Conducted:**
  - Benchmark polls (before campaign, early baseline)
  - Tracking polls (daily or continuous polling, rolling average)
  - Post-debate polls (immediately after debate)
  - Post-event polls (after major event, scandal, announcement)
  - Pre-election polls (final week, final day, day-of)

- **Poll Timing Effects:**
  - Recency bias (most recent poll given more weight)
  - Debate bump (candidate gets bump in polls after debate)
  - Event bump (candidate gets bump after positive event)
  - Scandal drop (candidate loses support after scandal)
  - Recovery time (how long does bump/drop last)

# 19. SOCIAL NETWORKS & INFORMATION DIFFUSION

## 19.1 Social Network Structure

### 19.1.1 Network Properties
- **Scale-Free Networks:**
  - Some people have many followers (hubs, influencers)
  - Most people have few followers (ordinary people)
  - Hub failure: if remove influencers, network fragments
  - Resilience: network robust to random removal

- **Small World Property:**
  - Short path lengths (few degrees of separation)
  - High clustering (friends of friends are friends)
  - Makes diffusion fast and efficient

- **Homophily (Birds of a Feather):**
  - Similar people are friends (demographic, ideological, etc.)
  - Politically homogeneous networks (echo chambers)
  - Politically diverse networks (cross-cutting exposure)
  - Homophily strength (how segregated are networks)

### 19.1.2 Information Cascades
- **Cascade Mechanics:**
  - Person A adopts belief/behavior
  - Person B sees A adopted it
  - B infers belief is good (herding)
  - B adopts belief
  - Person C sees A and B adopted it
  - C infers belief is very good
  - C adopts belief
  - Cascade grows: A→B→C→D→E→F

- **Cascade Conditions:**
  - Information is private (uncertain)
  - Observable actions (public, can see what others do)
  - Rational inference (assume others have info)
  - Herding: follow others without independent judgment

- **Cascade Failure:**
  - Information comes out that contradicts cascade (revealed)
  - Cascades can be wrong (many people believe false thing)
  - Reversal: cascade collapses if revealed as wrong
  - Persistence: some believe despite evidence (motivated reasoning)

### 19.1.3 Influence & Adoption
- **Influencers:**
  - Opinion leaders (people others look to)
  - Influencer reach (how many followers)
  - Influencer trust (how much followers trust)
  - Influencer platform (where operating: Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, etc.)
  - Influencer effect (how much do followers change views based on influencer)

- **Adoption Curves:**
  - Innovators (first 2-3% adopt)
  - Early adopters (next 13-16% adopt)
  - Early majority (next 34% adopt)
  - Late majority (next 34% adopt)
  - Laggards (last 13-16% adopt)
  - Time to adoption (how long from introduction to adoption)
  - Diffusion speed (fast or slow spread)

- **Network Effects:**
  - Value increases with adoption (more people use, more valuable)
  - Positive feedback (adoption breeds adoption)
  - Critical mass (need minimum adoption before value)
